/*
 Count words in a given string
 
 Given a string, count number of words in it. The words are separated by following characters: space (‘ ‘) or new line (‘\n’) or tab (‘\t’) or a combination of these.
 There can be many solutions to this problem. Following is a simple and interesting solution.  The idea is to maintain two states: IN and OUT. The state OUT indicates that a separator is seen. State IN indicates that a word character is seen. We increment word count when previous state is OUT and next character is a word character.

#include <stdio.h>

#define OUT	0
#define IN	1

// returns number of words in str
unsigned countWords(char *str)
{
    int state = OUT;
    unsigned wc = 0;  // word count
    
    // Scan all characters one by one
    while (*str)
    {
        // If next character is a separator, set the state as OUT
        if (*str == ' ' || *str == '\n' || *str == '\t')
            state = OUT;
        
        // If next character is not a word separator and state is OUT,
        // then set the state as IN and increment word count
        else if (state == OUT)
        {
            state = IN;
            ++wc;
        }
        
        // Move to next character
        ++str;
    }
    
    return wc;
